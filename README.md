## Why Certify365?

Enterprise LMS platforms like Learn365 charge $31,000+/year. We believe modern teams shouldn't have to choose between powerful features and reasonable pricing.

**Certify365** delivers:
- 📚 **Course Builder** — Create engaging courses with AI assistance
- 🏆 **Certificate Designer** — Drag-and-drop templates with QR verification  
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** — Track completion, compliance, and ROI
- 👥 **Team Management** — Auto-enrollment, reminders, accountability
- 🛤️ **Learning Paths** — Sequential progressions with prerequisites
- 🔒 **Compliance Ready** — Audit trails, expiration tracking, SOC 2

All starting at **$99/month** — 75% less than enterprise alternatives.
